# Exercise Calorie Calculator

This is my first **public** Python project, and I'm really excited to share it! The program allows users to input their age, weight, heart rate, and exercise time to calculate the calories burned during their workout.

## Features
- Supports both **imperial** (pounds) and **metric** (kilograms) unit systems.
- Calculates calories burned based on user inputs such as age, weight, heart rate, and exercise duration.

## How to Run

1. Clone the project using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jordycg/Calories-Burned-During-Exercise.git

2. Run the Python file:
   python main.py

## Example Usage
```bash
Imperial = lbs
Metric = kg
Choose your unit system (imperial or metric): imperial
Enter your age: 25
Enter your heart rate (bpm): 150
Enter the elapsed time of exercise (mins): 30
Enter your weight (pounds): 160
Calories: 350.24 calories

I hope you find this useful. This project represents a step forward in my learning and I look forward to implementing this into larger scale projects in the future
